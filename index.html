        <h2>About Lumpy Skin Disease</h2>
        <p>Lumpy Skin Disease is a viral disease affecting cattle, causing nodules on the skin and other symptoms. This disease can lead to economic losses in livestock farming.Recently, Lumpy Skin Disease has been a terrifying threat to cattle in Southeast Asia. Lump-like nodules are developed in the external skin and mucous membrane with fever. The economic importance of LSD limited numbers of studies are accessible on this extremely devasting arthropod borne disease in south and East Asian states. In future there are greater chances of this LSDV are also transmit into the humans. For avoiding this, study of lumpy skin disease is most important. We can also cure LSD with herbal treatment we have some evidence of this in our research. 
            Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is an infectious disease in cattle caused by Lumpy Skin Disease Virus (LSDV). Considering the disease burden, morbidity and mortality of cattle are more sensitive than Buffalows and other ruminants. Unfortunately, vaccines are used to control disease transmission, but they do not cure the LSD. 
            The incubation period ranges from 1-4 weeks leading to viremia. It is commonly arthropod-borne contagious illness and correspondingly the non-vector spreading through body discharge. It mainly originated in African countries.</p>

        <h2>Treatment & Medicine</h2>
        <p>After extensive research, I developed a medicine to treat Lumpy Skin Disease, approved by a veterinary doctor.This formulation is totally herbal base. In that neem, papaya fruit, Kalmegh  tulsi leaves, ginger, garlic, grape extract, harda powder, Ashwagandha, guggul, carrots, Liquorice, calendula leaves, coriander, turmeric powder extract are used. 
            During the experimental trial, a 100g sample of Herbavive was sent to Veterinary Doctor. The formulation was instructed to be applied 2-3 times daily on open wounds for a period of 4-5days. It was observed that the powder effectively dried the ruptured skin and promoted the regeneration of new skin.
            Additionally, a 100g sample of AniBotanix powder was administered to an infected animal. The recommended dosage was 2-3 spoon of powder mixed with jaggery or water to be given twice a daily. This treatment demonstrated the potential to enhance the animals resistance to Lumpy skin disease by reducing fever and boosting immunity.</p>
